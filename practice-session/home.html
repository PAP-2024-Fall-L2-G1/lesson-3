        <h2>Clubs</h2>
        <p>This year I decided to focus more on the technical clubs such as Skills USA and Robotics 
            because i plan on attending university for engineering majors. However, 
            I'm still the president of Japanese club so I continues to plan actvities such as crafts and 
            language learning in that club.</p>

        <h2>Online courses and competition</h2>
        <p>I have always appreciated the flexibility of online learning which allows me 
            to explore interests in the technology world. Additionally, joinging 
            competitions like hackathons allows me to apply new skills in practical settings 
            and connect with other students who share similar passions. </p>
